ASSIGNMENT 4 â€“ Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python
Overview
This assignment demonstrates working with file handling, exceptions, and error management in Python. It includes two tasks:

Reading a file and handling errors.

Writing, appending, and reading file data from user input.

Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.

Prints its content line by line.

Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

Implementation
The program attempts to open sample.txt in read mode.

If the file exists, it reads its contents and prints them.

If the file does not exist, it produces an error that can be handled using exception handling.

Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Problem Statement
Write a Python program that:

Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.

Appends additional data to the same file.

Reads and displays the final content of the file.

Implementation
The program takes text input from the user and writes it to output.txt.

It then takes additional input and appends it to the same file.

Finally, it reads and prints the complete content of output.txt.
